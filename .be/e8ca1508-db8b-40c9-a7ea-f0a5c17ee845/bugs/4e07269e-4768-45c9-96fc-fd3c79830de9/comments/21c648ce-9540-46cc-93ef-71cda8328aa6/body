One example: if you upload several files at once, it'll redirect you 
to /login and update_rf_list() will tell you that you passed a bad
value to it. 

However, this has also happened to me other times when I was trying to 
go to different URLs after I had already logged in.

Once you log in again, it's fine for a while. 

Maybe this is a sessions problem?
